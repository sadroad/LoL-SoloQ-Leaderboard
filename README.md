# LoL-SoloQ-Leaderboard
A simple Discord Bot to create a leaderboard in a given channel

This was a day project I made on a whim. Most of the code is probably terrible and could use a lot of improvment, but I cba fixing it.

If you want to run it update the values in `.env.local` and change the name to `.env`
